First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me. second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath. not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!
